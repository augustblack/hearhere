# hearhere

*Hearhere* is a user-centric radio application that allows multiple users to input short segments of sound to an FM station live from their browsers (on desktop or mobile).  It is an experiment in building a democratic and reactive electronic *space* where users can connect direct live audio from disperate remote locations to a central FM broadcast.

*Hearhere* uses new web technologies like WebRTC, WebAudioApi, and websockets to connect users into one radiophonic event.  The systme consists of a single  server (zentrum.html) and multiple clients (user.html). The WebRTC compenent currently runs throug PeerJS's servers. See http://peerjs.com/
